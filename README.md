## Trillo

A tour agency app. This project was built as a part of Jonas Schmedtmann's "Advanced CSS and Sass" course. See the final result: https://chipa014-trillo.netlify.app/

### Notes

I've continued using React module architecture instead of the 7-1 principle. This time I roughly knew what I was doing from the get-go, so this turned out much cleaner.

After the hell of a thousand imports just to use some damn variables, I'm in love with CSS's variables feature.
Flexbox, my beloved. After writing media queries for the flow layouts, this feels like a person is supposed to use this and not feel pain.

The BEM notation is deliberately ignored. Turns out it's not really necessary when your components have 3-5 different classes each.

There's definitely space for improvement. I decided to skip the challenges offered in the course to advance further in the course. I feel I'm going to be facing similar challenges in the pet project I'm considering after I learn about grids. This website could also be made interactive with the power of React, which I'm also deliberately ignoring. As of now, I'm happy with where it ended up as an exercise and I'm excited to learn the next thing.
